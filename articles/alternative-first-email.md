Congratulations on Your New SendGrid Account!

Let's get you setup. It's quick and easy.

Paste the following into your browser to send your first email:

```
https://api.sendgrid.com/api/mail.send.json?api_user=USERNAME&api_key=PASSWORD&to=you@yourself.com&from=you@yourself.com&subject=SendGridTest&text=My first email from SendGrid!
```

Wasn't that easy! SendGrid uses a [Web API](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/) to make sending super simple.

Next Steps:

Option 1: Likely, you program in a language like PHP, Ruby or Node.js. We have drop-in libraries ready to go for you! Check them out [on our GitHub Page](https://github.com/sendgrid).

Option 2: Or if you are looking to simply change your SMTP credentials with your current setup, we support that too with our [SMTP Relay](http://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/index.html). Instructions to change your SMTP credentials are [here](http://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/index.html) and takes just a few minutes!

If you need help, just reply to this email. We'll get back to you with the answers you need.

Best,
The SendGrid Team
