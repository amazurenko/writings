# Happy Hours with Jacob Lowe

Jacob Lowe knows his happy hours. Every week we try and hit up a great happy hour spot in LA. We talk tech and negotiate bills. Wrecking ball playing on the radio, JavaScript, and vegan places yo.

## The Library -  4/16

I think we only spent $20 - total. $10 each. Food was tasty, Jacob had a bear, I mean a beer. I had a sparkling water because I was feeling french.

## Sake House Hikari - 5/7

Very fresh Sashimi. I recommend it. Also a pitcher of beer is only $7. Jacob says "the mussels are really good. Like a baked mussle or something". Was not as cheap. Total spent was $58.
