# Moderating a tech panel

I recently moderated my first tech panel. It was on [the day in the life of a developer](https://generalassemb.ly/education/techs-most-wanted-influential-developers-of-la). This page will serve as a place I put questions/topics/prompts for such a panel - to keep the conversation flowing between the panelists. Feel free to borrow from and share back your own.

## Developer Focused

+ intros - say about yourself briefly and whether you think bitcoin is going up or down (or something funny they could say in context to the times)
+ how'd you come into programming. classicaly trained or self-taught?
+ making games as development. comment on that, is it like web development or different.
+ serious gaming. you do games that are more serious and designed to gamify someone's life. comment on that.
+ describe your day to day. how do you take your coffee and how do you spend your time as a dev. is it really 8 hours of coding or a lot of thinking?
+ war stories/bad times - what are some of the things you remember messing up really badly. deleted any databases? tell us about the late nights.
+ what keeps you coming back though - even after those rough times. What is it about programming that keeps you always doing it. Why not quit and do something easier?
+ the movie 'Her', the future? or no?
+ what is the future of development? more people coding?
+ comment on the scarcity of developers today. will that continue in the future? Why are devs so wanted. Is it because software is eating the world?
+ women in development. comment on that - is there a problem with the scarcity there, is this problem working itself out, what will the future look like for women devs?
+ getting started in development. where should I start if I was going to start today?
