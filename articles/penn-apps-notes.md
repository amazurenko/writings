# Demos at PennApps

## Music Queue 2.0
'Perfect' event playlists. You choose an event from Facebook, then it finds the people in the event, and creates a playlist tailored for the people in the event. Uses Spotify. It's based on Facebook likes. 

## Vibe Back
Vibrations to tell you who contacted you. Rough demo. First they  did a video, and then they tried to demo it. You use the volume button in a certain coded order to send things like your location, or if you need help to your contacts.

## Synth
App that listens to you, knows where you are on the sheet, and then changes the pages automatically for you. Within a few measures it can figure out where you are. He demoed it by starting in the middle. Demo fail unfortunately. Looked like some cool tech.

## Droplet
You can drop notes and images on a location. If you are within a certain range of droplets it will show up on your feed. Android app. They sort of demoed it but not till the very end.

## Bitme
Each user gets their own address to the Bitme centralized bit coin wallet. You copy the wallet address, and send to that person's wallet as many bitcoins as you want to send.

## Swap
Framework for developers to remotely push changes to your iOS app. Great demo. Got right into it and showed it working live. You can switch colors, assets, and even send code like alerts. Uses push notifications to download the code and execute it. One line of code to implement it in your own app!

## Juke
Text message controlled music player. Kinda cool how you can play, pause, and go forward songs. Twilio for texts. Also combines Venmo to pay for songs like a jukebox. Good demo. They did a lot in the short time and no hiccups. 

## Netfixxed
They have good energy. Some movies you can watch on Netflix in one country that you can't in another. Netfixxed scrapes Netflix in all of these countries to let you watch it in another country. It seems like it mainly relies on Hola though. They are aggregating them all into one place. You still have to switch to hola to use it. There's also a bit of video chat built in. 

## Decrowder
iOS app that lets you take a picture of someone and removes everyone else that is moving from around you. You take a short video and then it gives you a compiled shot that just has you in the pic. Unfortunately their demo didn't work out. The app crashed. 

## Super Duper Mario
Introduces Mario into the real world. You can play Super Mario using the background around you. He'll stay on ledges, fall down edges, and you have to jump across things. Super cool!

## Voice controlled browser
Voice controlled browser. It's a chrome plugin I believe. You can click around by voice, you can define words and you'll get the definition back. You can say go to Facebook. Uses Chrome's browser API for the voice recognition. 

## Codify
Live coding online. You can collaborate on your software project. Seems well implemented. Uses Firebase. 

## Split Store
Private files are split into chunks and then stored on multiple vendors. iOS app to upload, then it slices it into chunks, and uploads it into chunks. The file is split locally as well which is great. 

## Texit (teck-it)
http://tex.sh - http://github.com/texit. Works with Latex and makes it easier somehow. You can also create raffles. 

## Agoura
Chrome browser add-on to Craigslist. You get more than the results of craigslist, you also get results from Facebook. 

## Wagerize
You bet on a wager. Nicely designed interface.

## Soundmesh
Combine phones and machines to play the same song at the same time. Helps to create a better, more fuller sound - or at the very least louder and more spread out. Created their own time sync protocol that works over websockets. 

## Weighly
You can take a picture to weigh things. You take a picture of the container, put some liquid in it, and then take a 2nd picture of it. It gives you the weight. The density is already known though, but quite impressive.

## Book Crooks
They figured out a way to steal books from google books. 

## ScreenShades
A browser plugin that adapts to your Netflix viewing of shows to blur out spoilers on twitter.
