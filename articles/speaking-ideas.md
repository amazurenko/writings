## Deprecating the Password: Email-only authentication

We should be evaluating whether the traditional username and password is the best form of authentication. I think there is a better way. I've open sourced something called Handshake.js that implements an email only authentication mechanism. It's inspired by two-part authentication, much simpler, and you can implement it in under 30 minutes. 

Come see a talk on the strengths and weaknesses of this new approach as well as a live coded demo.
