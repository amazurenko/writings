## Deprecating the Password: Email-only authentication

We should be evaluating whether the traditional username and password is the best form of authentication. I think there is a better way. I've open sourced something called Handshake.js that implements an email only authentication mechanism. It's inspired by two-part authentication, much simpler, and you can implement it in under 30 minutes. 

Come see a talk on the strengths and weaknesses of this new approach as well as a live coded demo.

- Ditching the password: Why we should and the alternatives available to us as developers
- Saying NO: We live to say yes, and it's giving us anxiety. Saying NO can free us up for what we do best - in our personal lives, in our family lives, and in our development lives.
- Human first API Design: APIs, SOAP, Hypermedia, REST - we get so dogmatic about it all! But on many occassions we should be putting humans first in our API design. Come here the reasons why, and how to do so intelligently.
- In N Out and McDonalds started out very similarly . In N Out chose a smaller menu (less features), and McDonalds chose a larger menu (more features). Overtime, they both then had to adjust logistics to handle this. In N Out was able to handle the logistics of still making fast food partially because the menu was so small it was easier to train people and stock goods. McDonalds had to make shittier food to keep logistics working - heated, more packaged, etc. Which do you want to be as you build your startup?
