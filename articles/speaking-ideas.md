## Deprecating the Password: Email-only authentication

We should be evaluating whether the traditional username and password is the best form of authentication. I think there is a better way. I've open sourced something called Handshake.js that implements an email only authentication mechanism. It's inspired by two-part authentication, much simpler, and you can implement it in under 30 minutes. 

Come see a talk on the strengths and weaknesses of this new approach as well as a live coded demo.

## Contra API

A talk on alternative approach to building your API in a non-restful fashion. The benefits and weaknesses of such an approach.

## Building Interactive Email

[[stolen from Mark](https://litmus.com/conference/boston)] From simple hover effects to complex multi page microsites, we'll look at the code used to build interactivity in email, the potential for what is possible, and how interactive email is supported across email clients. 

+ What is interactive/kinetic email?
+ How interactivity works: the code behind the magic
+ Punched card coding: advanced interactive techniques
+ Static, limited, and interactive email clients: what works where?

## The past is the future and the future is the past

Punch card coding is brining the past to the future. 

## Become a MacGyver: How to start building your own interactive emails

MacGyver did it with paperclips and duct tape; you can do it with radio buttons and CSS. 

From simple hover effects to complex mailable microsites, we’ll look at the code used to build interactivity in email and show you how to string it together yourself. Get your text editors ready, there will be some live code.

## "Email first": A development approach you should consider.

In the past we built for desktop, then we built for the web, then we
built 'mobile first' applications. There is a new one 'email first' applications. 

In this talk I'll show you the benefits and pitfalls of 'email first'
development. I'll also show you how to build your first interactive email app.

+ Ditching the password: Why we should and the alternatives available to us as developers
+ Saying NO: We live to say yes, and it's giving us anxiety. Saying NO can free us up for what we do best - in our personal lives, in our family lives, and in our development lives.
+ Human first API Design: APIs, SOAP, Hypermedia, REST - we get so dogmatic about it all! But on many occassions we should be putting humans first in our API design. Come here the reasons why, and how to do so intelligently.
+ In N Out and McDonalds started out very similarly . In N Out chose a smaller menu (less features), and McDonalds chose a larger menu (more features). Overtime, they both then had to adjust logistics to handle this. In N Out was able to handle the logistics of still making fast food partially because the menu was so small it was easier to train people and stock goods. McDonalds had to make shittier food to keep logistics working - heated, more packaged, etc. Which do you want to be as you build your startup?  
+ On Hiring: "Re: Long Term Vision - Awesome. Def keep in in there. In fact, I have a few thoughts around this kind of stuff. IMO, everyone in a startup should have a “personal vision” for the company, especially non-founders. I would say a vision is nothing more than the fusion of one’s values/passions with the reach of an organization’s resources. As a result of that unique equation, everyone’s “vision” has a slightly different shade to it…and that’s totally OK. Recently, in my attempts to hire awesome folks, I’ve been using the word “fanatical” a lot. The word is just awesome. In terms of RebelMail, I think it means two things: 1) An a-ha moment about the impact of what we (as a team) are trying to do, and 2) the clarity/confidence that we (as a team) are definitely going to accomplish it. With Joe, it clicked. With Jake, it clicked. With Mark, it clicked. and with you, it definitely clicked. TLDR: If someone doesn’t have a vision (picture of the future) for the company that they hold close…they’re probably not the right fit for us. We’re in search of believers, not workers." credit: Trever Faden

+ Email First Applications. We used to develop desktop first applications. Then the world wide web came out, and we started building web first applications. At present, we largely build mobile first applications. Our technology will allow developers and designers in the future to ask themselves “should I build this as an email first application”.
