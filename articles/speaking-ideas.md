## Deprecating the Password: Email-only authentication

We should be evaluating whether the traditional username and password is the best form of authentication. I think there is a better way.

It's inspired by two-part authentication, much simpler, and you can implement it in under 30 minutes. 

Come see a talk on the strengths and weaknesses of this new approach as well as a live coded demo.

## Contra API

A talk on alternative approach to building your API in a non-restful fashion. The benefits and weaknesses of such an approach.
