## Team Names

### AUSome Car Pools
Stated the problem well: "Who's gonna pony up to pay the driver for a carpool." You click on a seat and then you choose where to and where from. They live sent the message which was good. Then you can press start trip, go on the trip, and then it will calculate and give you data on how much you should pay. Additionally, you can tip. Kicks you to the paypal API to pay.

### ForwardFundr
Kickstarter for beautification projects. It is a site to help people change their community. Using SendGrid to send email. Didn't get a chance to really show anything. Talked to long with intros before showing the app. Wrote his own PayPal library for Meteor and open sourced it.

### Trust in Dragons
You donate money and get receipts back. Also there is gamification. The more you donate, the more you rise up in labels and rankings. As the admin, you can quickly send via SMS and Email. You get an itemized list of wherever your dollar goes. 

### Missing Hippo
You create a 'flyer' that your dog is missing. You can post your dog as missing and you can get notified when it is found. Additionally, you can submit your zip code to be notified of missing dogs when it happens. It's a good idea that doesn't really exist. Good use of SendGrid as well to be notified when someone's dog in your area goes missing.

### DoGooder
Stated the problem really well and in a fun way. Organizations need a way to find us so we can do good for them - just like batman and superman do. We need our own Bat Signal. The app has a bat signal showing the upcoming events. You can then take that 'mission' (event). Integrated PayPal for donations. There is gamification like FourSquare a bit too.

### Tap to Pay
Login to your virtual store on your Rasberry Pi. It's a button you push to pay. It syncs with your phone somewhere. It uses SendGrid for the email notification/receipt. 

### Green Building
Interface to track data like temperature in a building (take that data), and then somehow associates people with that, and when you go over it emails the people in the room that they've gone over. Not quite grasping where he is getting the data and how it is sending an email to pay via PayPal.

### TipTastic
You have to be physically close to whoever you are tipping. You can click on the person you want to tip (only shows people close to you), and then you can tip them via PayPal.

### Safe Walk
States the problem well about needing a safe walk home. You can modify your route to go around some bad/dangerous/crime-popular areas. Also works with driving. You can email the directions to yourself using SendGrid. Explained things well. 

### PayPup
Listing puppies in the area that need to be adopted. Scraped the data from their site. The animal agencies need a way to get donations for their pups. You can donate or share the dog. Super awesome presentation and great amount of code.
