My name is Scott

I'm with a little startup called SendGrid.

For those who haven't heard of us, it is an API company.

We make it super simple to send and receive email from your applications.

Think of us as a turn-key solution for anytime you need to deal with anybody's email in your app. Password resets, send an email.

During this demo I am going to show you exactly how easy it is to use SendGrid.
