My name is Scott

I'm with a little startup called SendGrid.

For those who haven't heard of us, it is an API company.

We make it super simple to send and receive email from your applications.

Think of us as a turn-key solution for anytime you need to deal with anybody's email in your app. Password resets, send an email.

During this demo I am going to show you exactly how easy it is to use SendGrid.




Best SendGrid prize we are giving out. 

You can find our docs at 

Hack.sendgrid.com will get you all setup.

You can find our GitHub at .

We'll be giving out shirts, and hacking. Come find us.

It should show the SendGrid API in action, mashed up with something else.

I need a new demo. My most recent one has been making a circle with a leap motion. It's a 
variation of Swift's with the arduino. 

Previous to that I built a small mini-site and showed how you could send email using
JavaScript and SendGrid.

I need something that uses the inbound parse api though. You receive an email, or it 
encourages the users to send in an email.

Hey hackers, get your phones out. Send an email to this address. Then I live code it? No. 
It needs to be ready to accept that data as the emails come in.

Maybe they tweet out to me by sending an email. It actually tweets from my account, maybe?

Maybe if there is a critical enough mass of people then it works?

Take a selfie of yourself and email it? I really liked this with Robin's because it was fun.
Selfies are cool. 

Take a picture of your shoes? Pictures of your shoes are the new selfies?? Joke like that maybe.

Do something funny if possible. People like to laugh. I'm not that funny though, but it's an
act. I could be. Maybe something w/ Hollywood and LA. Email your favorite actor or actress in?

Turn hollywood pictures into something funny? Pictures are funny so sending in a picture would be cool.

Send email via encrypted speakers?
