## Presentations

### Elert

Automated home security system using Android device. It uses the camera and the mic in the phone to detect noise levels and movement.

### Boswash

Crowdfunding and cleaning public spaces. You can post a bounty for a space/area/spot that needs to cleaned (like maybe some trash), and then others can pick up the bounty by cleaning up and taking a picture of it. Integrated PayPal and also integrated SendGrid for email receipts. Good presentation and answered the questions well.

### GetSkooled

Funding education one fantasy draft at a time. High schoolers register to get paid to make good grades. People buy in to make fantasy teams of students. Very original idea! 

### RSVP Plus

You can send notifications to people for your events. Uses SendGrid but not really. Wasn't coded into there but they had plans to do it.

### fundB

Payday Loans - 400% APR. 12M people use payday loans. FundB makes borrowing money easy. You chip-in to the pool. You get a push notification. You help your friends out somehow by funding your friends' loan requests. 

### Flash Show

You send a flash show link to your friends, and then flash show makes sure you can watch a tv show at the same time. You can watch 2 shows at exactly the same time. The demo is not working out though. It's coming up blank. Algorithm lives on the front-end to keep things in sync.

### Feud Funding

Putting your money where you moth is. The entire app is pitting mainly political organizations against each other. You express your opinion on issues and donate to causes at the same time. The issues are user submitted and filtered by the internal team. Choosing an option contributes $1 to the entire pot. With SendGrid you can press just 1 button and send an email to all your friends to let them know about the issue.

### Authentic Meds

Verify the authenticity of the medicine/product they buy. I didn't quite grasp it completely. They are sort of in the middle handling the money between a transaction for medicine. You have to put on stickers on a product to make it work. 

### Seek

Rentable tracking arm bands you put on your kids. They come out of a dispener like a red box. Then you pair it with your phone via NFC. You can track your kid then, and it will notify you if you she goes outside a certain radius.

### PhilanthroFeed

You can see a feed of homeless people, then you can donate to them for meals. It gives the homeless person credit with a local restaurant. Then he uses that credit to pay for his meal.

### HoboApp

As a homeless person you can see nearby providers to that can help you as a homeless person - things like shelters, food banks, and clinics. 

### CrowdPowered

Coordinate local projects and find volunteers or people willing to donate to the local projects. Working interface of forms and saving data. 

### ScanPal

Wearable computing to interact with advertisements. Extracts advertisement from the image, and based on the advertisement it will use google's reverse image search, and then it finds the product on Amazon and Ebay. You can do one-touch buying also using glass.

### HereUs

Proximity based petition platform. We geo-tag based on issue location. You can create local petitions that are geo-tagged. Others can see the petitions around them. 

### TwitterHam

Twitter Marketing. I didn't fully grasp what it did. Just seemed like a website that was put up.

### Tapd

Payments with just a tap. Uses SendGrid, Paypal, and Twilio. Mobile interface, NFC tech, and a dashboard. A notification on glass as well. Lots of tech skills there. 

### 2Roads

You choose your routes and then the app each day lets you know if one of your routes is bad and recommends the other. If all are bad it sends you an email with a restaurant deal via SendGrid.

### Smart Money

You can get notifications about the best lotto tickets. He scraped the lotto data and picked the best ones. You can pay and get an email with the list of the best lotto tickets.

### Slideshow

Demo was confusing, but it was a way to control slides from your phone and keep it in sync.
