# Code Day Promotion Talk

My name is Scott Motte. I work for a tech startup that started right here at UCR. We're called SendGrid and we make it super simple to send and receive email. 

But that's not why I'm here. I'm here to tell you about a hackathon we are sponsoring.

Who has heard of hackathons?

Hackathons are 24 hour competitions where you build something cool in 24 hours. 

There is a really good one coming up on the 18th-19th in Santa Monica. It's called CodeDayLA.

If you guys want to build something cool in 24 hours - like a game or a mobile app - this is the event to go to. 

For example, what is something you could build? Instead of telling, let's show. Let's build something small in the next few minutes. 

I have this Arduino here. It's a little programmable computer board. I can write code to it to run commands. A lot of robots nowadays are actually built on top of little boards like this called Arduinos.

So that is an example of something you could build.

So, hope to see you guys at CodeDayLA. Get signed up at http://la.codeday.org.
