Hi SendGrid,

You're a great company. I remember you guys as practically the first add-on for Heroku's platform. That was the first time I used your service. Since then I've used your service many times on different client projects. 

Then I remember when I first learned that you were started by a couple of UCR graduates. I had started a Ruby meetup group in the Riverside area, and SendGrid came up in conversation. A member named Mike mentioned you were founded by a couple UCR graduates. That was good to hear because, at the time, it was the only startup success I had heard of coming out of Riverside. So thanks for the inspiration!

Since then I started and still organize RiversideJS, co-organize StartupIE, and am one of the founders of Riverside.io - a coworking space just getting off the ground in downtown Riverside. And last weekend we just held Riverside's first Startup Weekend. 

I guess the point I am making is that I like to grow tech communities, and I'd like to do that at SendGrid.

I'd like to be your west coast developer evangelist. I'm a developer by trade. You can get a better picture of me at http://scottmotte.com. I enjoy hackathons, I love writing APIs, and I'm an increasingly good public speaker. You guys have such a great platform and from what I've seen and heard a great culture, and I'd like to evangelize that.

Best,
Scott
