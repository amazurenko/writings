# css design

Elegance - easy beauty that is simple, straightforward, and unarguable. This is what I want in my designs. I want a style guide for my programming life. When I build a new site it will take on this style guide. It will become my identity. It will be known as a site built by @scottmotte. They will all have this look and style and it will be nostalgic. It will be forever tweaked, but will change the style across all my sites instantly. It will be motte design. 

How do I do this. What will it look like. 

I find iaWriter to be an excellent design implementation. I find large font to be necessary. I find whitespace and font choice to be imperative. It's the balance of the two really. 

I also love writing in markdown. Should the sites be written in markdown and allow JS to convert them. This way they are consumable as markdown - easily parseable - but visually look like html when in the browser. This would require loading JS as well - not just CSS.

I want to avoid a grid to start. I'm tired of grids. In fact, I want to avoid everything - as much as possible. I want to use the built in styling. It's already responsive. It looks good on all devices. It's long form writing. How do I get to this look. 

I also want to use the same login system for all my sites - handshake.js. I want to become an artist - an artist of consistency. My sites will be of germany efficiency and post modern cleanliness. The effort will be focused on the least amount of work possible but unflinching dedication to perfect the usefulness of it. Text is so good for that. I wish more of the internet was just text. But the text is unattractive at the moment. 

Where do I start. All great designs start with stealing. I must steal, learn design well, and only then could I branch out. When I begin, I must limit my colors to very few. I must ignore trends and instead find something that will never disappear. Where do I go for this inspiration. What sites were beautiful of a timeless quality.

Maybe paper is what I should look to. And postmodernism. 

The book hasn't changed much. It is of the same form factor, the same spacing, and the same coloring. 

I like the way markdown limits your tools. Limits are good when going after a design like this. I should be limited to only use certain elements. Markdown would help with that.

I really love writing in iaWriter. It's been excellent.

Use <hrs> and block quotes and images. Background images? Nope, leave it out on the first version.

I think doing away with the navbar in place of a navigation system like on docs.withdraft.com would be a better move.

Can all of these be built in small modules. If they were you can have the bits you need. But can't we keep it small enough to not have to do that. Can we not keep this css absolutely tiny.

Traditional wisdom puts readable line length at 40-60 characters (http://css-tricks.com/the-usability-problems-of-useitcom/)

Search should be built in. It should work and work amazing - via some JavaScript I suppose. Maybe put the word search and that is where the search bar ends up.

37 signals blog is a good source.

http://37signals.com/ site is mostly text now. They are on to something.

I like the card look though too.
