It's a very old tool. It's 40 years old but it hasn't been deprecated yet, but it makes me wonder why. It doesn't focus on a specific generation or specific environment. It connects with a wide range of different user. It can have the presence of formality or be very informal. You can talk with different companies, clubs, friends, and there is really no barrier.
