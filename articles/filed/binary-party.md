Binary Party. Year 0.

You are invited to an epic scene. Party with laser cats. Party like tron. 

The last 13 months have been exciting for Riverside's tech scene. StartupWeekend happened. StartupIE has grown to large numbers. RiversideJS's tight nit group expands. Riverside.io is very close to opening a much need coworking space.

Riverside is becoming a great place to be a developer, a designer, a maker. 

But most importantly relationships are building. In Riverside we all know each other. We help each other. We are all part of building and defining the culture for this new tech community. And it's a warm community, a friendly one. I've met many good friends through Riverside's burgeoning tech scene. I feel a part of something bigger and I think many others do too.

Let's come together and celebrate that!

Join us for the zero-eth annual Binary Party. Binary Party. Year 0. 

There will be food, libations, lasers, lights, music, algorithms, and so much more. Silicon Valley style. Let's party Riverside technologists. Let's celebrate.
