# Budget

I'm trying to get a better idea of things I spend money on but don't think about. Like how much am I actually paying in fees and taxes to the government to be in accordance with the law - so I can be aware and save appropriately.

Costs are rounded, and per year.

| Line Item                                   | Cost                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Toyota Truck Auto Insurance                 | $500                    |
