Email with some hardware

Hubot of email. Send him an email and he talks to you. He could listen to your emails too.

Static generated app framework. Build out old fashioned websites/webapps using static pages and your seperate api. Some sort of framework for that. Use something like tilt possibly. You make an ajax call to your API. Your API has a rails like callback (before_save) and generates the new HTML with the newly created object. It then makes a git commit with that updated HTML. And then on the front-end the page refreshes, and the new static HTML has that new data. History in git commits that way and data also in the database. Super fast rendering because you are servign static HTML. Privacy issue - you'd have to have some secret token for logged in pages because the content would be different per user.

App that turns your Tinder into the perfect pic. Or it turns it into a meme. Or it turns it into a trick to convince the person to swipe the other way. This would be pretty fun for a hackathon.

Geocoded git commits. It'd be interesting to see when/where I was more productive with my code. Maybe it was on a bus to Phoenix.

An app that tells you how many times you open other apps. So you can stop being fucking ADD.

An app that takes your email and prints it out, and sends you the printed mails once a month. It's a printed email - designed for those who need to be on the "bottom of things" as [Knuth on email](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/email.html) so aptly put it.

An app that you can quickly stand up and start accepting SendGrid events to. It'd probably use redis to store the event data, or S3 or something else. Contact Paul Richards when completing this one. You met him at SendGrid Delivered San Diego and he has use of this.
