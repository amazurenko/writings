[+] An app that takes your email and prints it out, and sends you the printed mails once a month. It's a printed email - designed for those who need to be on the "bottom of things" as [Knuth on email](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/email.html) so aptly put it. Created as [retromail](http://github.com/scottmotte/retromail)

[+] Sendgrid Wordpress plugin - someone built [this](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sendgrid/)

Gifsockets to see how long someone is on an email

Emo Email

Webhook notifier with email (to test webhooks)

App that takes all your forwarded emails, parses them for keywords, and fires an event/text based on that keyword.

Email with some hardware

Hubot of email. Send him an email and he talks to you. He could listen to your emails too.

Static generated app framework. Build out old fashioned websites/webapps using static pages and your seperate api. Some sort of framework for that. Use something like tilt possibly. You make an ajax call to your API. Your API has a rails like callback (before_save) and generates the new HTML with the newly created object. It then makes a git commit with that updated HTML. And then on the front-end the page refreshes, and the new static HTML has that new data. History in git commits that way and data also in the database. Super fast rendering because you are servign static HTML. Privacy issue - you'd have to have some secret token for logged in pages because the content would be different per user.

App that turns your Tinder into the perfect pic. Or it turns it into a meme. Or it turns it into a trick to convince the person to swipe the other way. This would be pretty fun for a hackathon.

jQuery on the server. Somehow make it so people who only know jQuery can creat a server. Build on top of node likely

Airline seating chart that seats you according to interests, age, sex, and/or relationship status.

App that splits your email into multiple words. Then it comes back and brings it back together into one email.

Replace car alarms with push notifications or text messages to your phone

USB shoes. The shoes charge em the laces have USB or miniusb ends

Geocoded git commits. It'd be interesting to see when/where I was more productive with my code. Maybe it was on a bus to Phoenix. Resources for this: https://github.com/robmathers/WhereAmI, git@github.com:lindes/get-location.git 

An app that tells you how many times you open other apps. So you can stop being fucking ADD.


An app that you can quickly stand up and start accepting SendGrid events to. It'd probably use redis to store the event data, or S3 or something else. Contact Paul Richards when completing this one. You met him at SendGrid Delivered San Diego and he has use of this. 

It would be cool that as you hit certain keys on your keyboard it would record sounds associated with each key. Then asyou coded your project it would create a rythm and musical sound to how you code. You could play it back and see how your coding was the past few hours.

Houses should be smart with their lights. When the sun starts going down they should start dimming. They should turn off completely in certain rooms like the tv room - which would force me to move to my bedroom where there is still a light on. Then I'd sit down to read and unwind, and then that should makes its way to eventually dim out and then my body would physically feel it is time for bed and I would go to bed at a decent hour. I shouldn't have to make decisions about turning off lights. My environment should make it for me like it does in the wild. My house, being my environment, should make the decisions healthy for me.

Do a blog post on hello world go to heroku deploy

If hypermedia could be implemented like it is envisioned it will likely take some great clients - like the web has a few key/great ones - Chrome, Firefox, IE. And interestingly those clients would become the clients we developers would all use to interact with APIs. We'd all stop writing libraries in our individual languages. Just random thought I wanted to write down. There's an opportunity there to build those clients. The best client(s) will win.

StuddyBuddy - an app like Tinder, but pulls in your college class schedule. Then it does all the hard work of recommending times to meetup and study and showing you a list of pictures of people to study with. This list could be laid out in a Tinder style - where you swipe right and left. The ultimate goal being that you have a studdy buddy that could lead to something more. This gives meeting up a pretense, you get some studying with someone you might never have met, and you possibly lead to something more.

Possible article - do a talk on the digitalocean gem I've built and how it's metaprogrammed on top off their API. How their API urls have essentially become the 'definition' - sort of like the basics of hypermedia, but much easier. That url is converted to methods and adding new methods is just adding to a json file. I should talk about how when I switched to this, I literally had a pull request 30 minutes later adding a new url endpoint. It was that easy for contribution, he wrote a spec, and it just worked.

You should be punished for sending email after hours. There should be an email client for businesses that punishes it's employees for trying to send email after certain business hours. This shouldn't punish them in a bad way, but it could go into their performance reviews. At the very least it'd be handy data for a company to know - how many of their employees are needing to work after hours. Maybe they are working too hard, maybe the hard work was necessary because the company was young, maybe no work is getting done in the office environment.
