## Riverside.io Proposal

I propose we do the following as soon as possible. 

We place [14 acoustic panels](http://www.atsacoustics.com/item--ATS-Acoustic-Panel-24-x-48-x-4--1008.html?d=GPGEN01&kw=1008-D) on the starboard wall. They would be broken into 2 rows of 7 each. A row at approximately human height, and a row above that row up towards the ceiling.

This would almost assuredly fix the terrible acoustics in the space. I feel it is our biggest problem with the space. When people come in, it is loud, and difficult to have a conversation - even for those of us who have been in the space for a while and have become accustomed to it.

Secondly, we place [Startup Vitamin Posters](http://www.startupvitamins.com/) over the panels. These would fit the panel size quite well (a few inches would be exposed on the top and bottom of the panel prospectively).

This would help fix the terrible lack of style we currently have in the place. It doesn't feel cool yet and a like a place you truly want to hang out at. These vitamin posters are cool, are inspirational, and they would be visible from the street when on the starboard wall. Additionally, because they would be on top of the panels, they would stick out a bit more, adding to the visual appeal.

I'd like to see a month's worth of revenues spent on this. Our rent is covered for a year. Woot! So let's invest a month's worth of revenues at this time. I think these 2 things will fix the 2 biggest drawbacks we have to getting people in the space right now - acoustics and style. Let's fix that and bring in another 5 people.

## Details

Acoustics - [http://www.atsacoustics.com/item--ATS-Acoustic-Panel-24-x-48-x-4--1008.html?d=GPGEN01&kw=1008-D](http://www.atsacoustics.com/item--ATS-Acoustic-Panel-24-x-48-x-4--1008.html?d=GPGEN01&kw=1008-D)

## Cost Break down

**$1,100 total.**

* 15 24"x48" Acoustic panels @ $60 each - $900
* 10 24"x36" Startup Vitamin Posters @ $30 each - $300

$1,200 total.

(additionally, I think purchasing 10 vitamin posters up front and being a coworking/hackerspace could get us the 10 posters at a price of just $200 which would bring the cost down to just $1,100)

## Conclusion

Let's do this! It would really help the space, and I think is the next step. 

Then if we do roughly one 'big' thing a month (investing 1 month's rent ahead of time), we could make great strides over the course of the immediate 6 months - both in increasing membership and improving the space.

And we're only risking one month at a time then which would more than likely increase membership anyways netting us more money.

Finally, improving this space will go a long ways I think to increasing what I would call 'long term goals' of the fundraising effort. The amount of money for those items is larger, and an attractive space would very much help with those fundraising efforts I believe.
