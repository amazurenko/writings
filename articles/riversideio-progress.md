## Members

18 total members.

### New

We've added 6 new members in January and February. 

One of these is Gustavo. He is a student at UCR and wanted to get more involved in startups to supplement his computer science studies. He decided Riverside.io is the place to be for that. 

Another new member is Stephen Harbauer. Stephen uses the space once a week on Saturdays to teach kids how to program and program games. It's completely free for attendees. 

A third of these 4 members is Claressa. Claressa is an artist and designer. She adds a creative aspect to the space, and is a talented designer.

The fourth of these is Judd. Judd moved from Las Vegas just last week. He organized the Ruby meetup group there which was one of th e largest tech meetup groups in Vegas. He was extremely missed by his Vegas friends (because he was so involved). He found Riverside.io simply googling for startups and tech community in the Riverside area. He decided it was the place for him and joined on his first visit.

Kevin Carrington - CEO of Carrington Case. He's building a great product and is using Riverside.io as his main offices. He's also organizing a day long event to teach kids to code at Riverside.io in March.

Melissa Morgan - Melissa is a creative and a web designer. She's also has worked with the The Heart of America Foundation as their Director of External Communications for many years.

### Notable current

* Ralph's team, Maven2.0, continues to grow and their team grows in skills. Additionally, they are able to bounce ideas of other skilled programmers like Jacob Lowe and Scott Motte to help them make wise architecture and design designs for their client's needs.
* Kevin Chandler (who is very young) has gone from zero knowledge of programming to taking online Harvard classes in C coding. He also has been building his own application he is open sourcing to notify subscribers when movies become available on DVD or Netflix. He's on a path to have a $45,000/yr engineering job or better in just 5 months at Riverside.io. Part of that is being around mentors at Riverside.io and being a part of the tech 'scene' here. 
* Daniel Villarreal who works at UCR managing their servers, has found Riverside.io inspirational to start his own startup. He's been working hard on the weekends - starting the process make that a reality. 
* Jacob Lowe, who was one of the original founders of Riverside.io, continues to grow his skills nights and weekends at Riverside.io. He's now starting to apply to companies like Yahoo because of those growing skills.
