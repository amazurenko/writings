# SendGrid/Cloudfoundry Presentation Notes

Hi guys, my name is Scott Motte. 

I'm with a cool company called SendGrid. 

We're an API Company.

For those of you who haven't heard of us, we make it super simple to send and receive email in your application. 

You can think of us as a turnkey solution for all your email sending needs.

Password reset. Alert/Notification emails. 

So, we have an SMTP API and a Web API to do this, and now we also have this brand new CloudFoundry add-on.

Let me diverge for a bit and say that we are all about making Developers lives easier, and so are these guys AppDirect and CloudFoundry. That's why we partnered early on with them. And these guys have been great. We love what both of them are doing.

So here's a depiction of how we work together. We integrate with AppDirect and AppDirect integrates with CloudFoundry. There are some big benefits to this - namely that AppDirect made our own developer lives easier to get SendGrid onto CloudFoundry. Then CloudFoundry and us are able to jointly make developer's lives easier by providing email cabilities in very few lines of code.

So enough talk, let's show you how easy that process is to add email to your application while on CloudFoundry.

Then go into coding.
