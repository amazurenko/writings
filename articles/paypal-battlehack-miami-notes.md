### MD Library
Application to deliver books from the Library. 

### YellowPepper**
ATM machine for stores. It has the iPad tool for the merchant, and the iPhone/mobile app for finding merchants that will provide the ATM service. Uses SendGrid for the receipt emails. 

### Bill SplitR
Split bills with OCR and a bit of NFC.

### WinWin
Nice interface. iPhone app where you add todos and assign them values. If you finish the todo, then you get your money. If you don't complete it, then your money goes to a charity of your choice.

### SkyWarn Mobile Reporter
Working app, where you can report your weather, and it submits to the National Weather Service. 

### FlashFood Sale
Get food to the right people at the right time. Uses SendGrid to send the emails out.

### SnapNanny*
Find a babysitter right away. You can hire for the job. Gives a notification by email through SendGrid. 

### LocalHaute
Google glass related app. Say 'see fashion', and you get cardstacks of fashion. You can add your fashion offer (location based), so that if you are in Miami, you might get a Miami retailer's photos coming into your card stream when you say 'see fashion'.

### The Initiative*
You can post an initiative where other community members can see it and get involved - to help the community. Start the community online and then move it offline. Uses SendGrid to send out the emails.

### Redeemr.pw**
Call out a friend on someone's timeline and by email. Then you can redeem yourself by making a donation. It's a digital douchebag jar. Uses SendGrid to send the email out saying 'Admit it, you did it wrong!'. App is live too.

### Campus Garage Sale*
Localized craigslist to your school, but mobile interface. Using SendGrid to send out the conversational emails from the app to the person selling or buying.

### PawPal**
Cute play on Paypal name and cute logo. They stated the problem well concerning rescue animals. Integrates with PetFinder to show the animals. Lots of code, creates a page on Facebook for the campaign, how much you've raised. RAise money from friends so you can get your pet. People are helping to donate and you are getting your animal. Used SendGrid for all their email sending.

### PetNanny
You can find nannies to do your pet-sitting. Pet Nannies can post their services.

### Shake a Tour
Local tourism from locals. Mobile app that finds you a local tour guide. Nugget of a good idea. Implementation was rough.

### Funds4Kids
Fundraising for student teams and organizations. With the QR code, it shows you an event page for the fundraisers, you can click a button and donate via Paypal.

### Give Now
Donate to the homeless using your credit card. The homeless person has to have the app that I can tell though. What if they don't download it or don't have a smart phone?

### FacePay
You use your face to pay. Your face is linked to your paypal account. Does it actually do the facial recognition though? I couldn't tell from the presentation and the judges did not ask.

### Fundraise
Uses GPS points to raise funds. Like you run a marathon to raise funds, but instead to individual GPS waypoints. It makes it fun to raise money by exploring your city.

### Voluntier$
Like Carbon offsets but for volunteering. 

### Bandapp
Cashless payments with a wristband or a badge. Painful demo, but potentially a great idea. "Leave your wallet at home"

### CoinToss
Give random person some money.

### MoochNo.co
Turn moochers into contributors. Zero out group expenses. Good presentation. 

### DonorChange
iOS game to donate money. Love the idea of how the game's 'enemies' are populated with real data from the Non Profit. You donate to play. Nugget of a great idea here!

### ParkingEasy
Find parking structures/lots with open spaces near you. You can see the cost per hour, and it uses some arduino and other hardware to track how many cars are coming in and then leaving the parking lot. 

### WhoCanFetchIt
Where others can take care of your errands. A TaskRabbit basically.
