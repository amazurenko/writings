## I chose AirPair to help me build the SendGrid APEX library

[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.clm) didn't have an APEX library. Now we do. It's thanks to [AirPair](http://airpair.com). 

One month ago, our team at SendGrid made the decision to build an APEX library. Salesforce developers were increasingly choosing SendGrid as their email solution, but there were some unnecessary complexities. An APEX library would smooth out those complexities - making it easier to send email through SendGrid on Salesforce. 

But we had a problem. No one on SendGrid's engineering team had ever done Salesforce/APEX development.

I took on the task of developing the APEX library. I jumped into the Salesforce development environment and started coding. It was unfamiliar, had unique approaches to development, and had an involved configuration. I needed expert knowledge. My friend and colleague [Heitor](https://twitter.com/heitorburger) recommended AirPair.

I logged onto AirPair's website, found a Salesforce developer, and reserved some pairing time. Soon after I was contacted via email by [Igor](https://twitter.com/ilebovic) at AirPair. He introduced me to [Daniel](https://twitter.com/FishOfPrey). The 3 of us chatted over HipChat. We scheduled an hour session for the next day - 11AM my time on the Santa Monica coastline, 7AM Daniel's time on the New Zealand coastline.

Daniel was great. He knew his Salesforce, had a rad icon of [himself in a kayak](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1523377229/thumb.jpg), and put up with my complaints of the Salesforce development environment.

Within 30 minutes he had guided me to a [very nice Salesforce development environment](http://sendgrid.com/blog/hello-world-apex/). It fit my development style. I could tell this was going to be good.

I spent another 3.5 hours - broken up over the course of a week - pairing with Daniel over Google hangouts. In that short time, thanks to his guidance, I had a working [SendGrid Salesforce library](https://github.com/scottmotte/sendgrid-apex), knowledge of the APEX language, and the foundation I needed to self-teach myself from there.

The result was the release of [sendgrid-apex](https://github.com/scottmotte/sendgrid-apex). If you are a Salesforce developer, you can get it [here](https://github.com/scottmotte/sendgrid-apex).

The number one thing AirPair did was match me up with Daniel. They vetted a good developer that could also teach well. But AirPair also made sure the process was smooth. Igor kept things running on time, scheduled and setup our Google hangouts, and kicked off each of our pairing hangouts.

I'll be using AirPair in the future. It's a good service for getting up to speed quickly on a new development environment or complex coding task. Their hands on approach goes a long ways.
