# Long Live the Informal Hackathon

The [Major League Hackathons](http://mlh.io/) - [Penn Apps](http://2014s.pennapps.com/), [MHacks](http://mhacks.org/), [BoilerMake](http://boilermake.org/), and [HackTech](http://www.hacktech.io/) are great. Go to these. But go to the small hackathons too - the informal ones.

The first hackathon was [small](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon). I'm stating the obvious, but hackathons did not start as large organized events with multiple sponsors. They started as informal get togethers. People like you - the makers and creators - got together to create something cool.

Hold informal hackathons. Get a handful of friends, pick a venue like your coworking space or apartment, pitch in for some pizza and soda, invite others, and hack for 24 hours. 

Publicize your event on [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com), tweet it out, and put up posters around your school or neighborhood. You'll get a small attendance and it will be great.

My friends and I recently did this at [Riverside.io](http://riverside.io). We threw a [New Years Eve Hackathon](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/riverside-dot-io-new-years-hackathon-2014). Eleven people attended, [multiple](http://github.com/scottmotte/ansible-dogecoind) [different](http://github.com/scottmotte/kibble) [hacks](https://github.com/kevinchandler/kibble-frontend) were made and [built](https://github.com/riversideio/magnolia-bloom) upon. We had champagne at New Years and then went back to hacking. I met new people, learned new things, taught some things, and coded all night long. It was a wonderful informal experience.

The food was informal, sleeping was informal (bring your own sleeping bag), and the prize for best hack was informal. It was a Hobbit (the movie) themed set of Pez dispensers. We picked it up last minute at the nearby CVS Pharmacy.

Others have put on these small informal hackathons too. [Robin](http://twitter.com/rbin) and [Alex](http://twitter.com/alexerax) put on [Merry Haxmas](http://sendgrid.com/blog/two-hacking-santas-present-rails-the-inbound-parse-webhook/), [Yamil] put on [Puerto Rico's first hackathon](http://sendgrid.com/blog/puerto-rico-first-hackathon/), and [Nick](http://twitter.com/yaynickq) attended [Spocode](http://sendgrid.com/blog/atypical-hackathon/) and has blogged about maintaining the [good elements of small hackathons in the environment of the large hackathons](http://sendgrid.com/blog/youre-pricing-evangelist/).

Keep hacking. If you put on an informal hackathon, [let me know](http://twitter.com/scottmotte). Send me pictures. I'd love to share your story with others.
